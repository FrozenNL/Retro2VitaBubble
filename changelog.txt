v0.8
 - First changelog added to the project
 - Now supports 7-zipped roms for packed roms itself (.nes -> .7z), RetroArch does unpack 7z files (output only, input does not support zip/gzip)
 - Now the content of the folder _OUT will be backed up to _OUT.bak folder instead of just being deleted
 - Did some folder checkings (of they exist/do not exists) before creating or deleting folders in order to avoid error messages
 - Code cleanup
